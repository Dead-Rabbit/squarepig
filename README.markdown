This is squarepig: a simple game engine for HTML5.

Squarepig is intended to be simple; as comfortable for novice developers making their first Web games as for experienced coders building demos and prototypes. Squarepig takes some inspiration from the excellent Flashpunk (http://flashpunk.net) library for ActionScript.

Right now, Squarepig consists of one file: squarepig-0.1.js (or it's minifed sibling, squarepig-0.1.min.js). That's all you need! You can see a very basic demo working here: http://aeonofdiscord.com/squarepig

Squarepig is distributed under the zlib license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib_License), so you can use it however you feel like.

*That'll do, pig.*
